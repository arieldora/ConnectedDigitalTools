Readme file: “Quantifying the Use of Connected Digital Products in Clinical Research” (Marra, Chen, Coravos, and Stern)Created: February, 28, 2020Author: Ariel D. Stern

To use the data from this paper researchers have two options:

A) The first option is to simply download the final dataset (in Stata format) using file 1. File 2 contains a codebook in Excel.

1_device_trials_data_10Dec2019.dta
2_codebook.xls

B) The second options is to recreate the final dataset using raw flat files. File 3 is a Stata Do-file that combines raw data files to create the *dataset in file 1. 

*Note: for the published results in this study, raw files were downloaded from https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/pipe_files on December 10th, 2019  (they correspond to the 20191210_pipe-delimited-export.zip folder located on that webpage)

In order to re-create the full dataset from raw files (for example, if a researcher wanted to update the dataset at a later point in time), s/he would need the following flat files, available at the url above:

brief_summaries.txt
conditions.txt
countries.txt
design_groups.txt
design_outcomes.txt 
detailed_descriptions.txt 
interventions.txt 
intervention_other_names.txt 
sponsors.txt
